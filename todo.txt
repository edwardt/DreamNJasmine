How to support shared fixtures:
	Discovery:
	  Each specification can be enumerated independently.
	  When a sub-spec is encountered, that spec can be enumerated completely first.
	  
	  After it is enumerated, its resulting tests are projected onto the containing test.
	  The containing test's delegate passed to the sub-spec is executed for each branch in the contained test, extending the projected structure.

	Execution
	  The projected test steps use GlobalSetupOwner to move the contained fixture appropriately.
	  The delegate passed to the sub-spec is than ran as-is.


	Note: GlobalSetupManager isn't really the right thing, since it only runs global setup.
	  We're going to need something that maintains a thread running for each fixture, and then they'll need a corresponding GlobalSetupManagerfor the global setup associated with that fixture.
