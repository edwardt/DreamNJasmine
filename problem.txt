clone the repo at http://github.com/fschwiet/dreamnjasmine

Running powershell at the root of the repo, run:
  .\build

  cd .\bin\VS2012
  .\vstest.console.exe /listtests ..\SomeTestLibrary.dll
  .\vstest.console.exe ..\SomeTestLibrary.dll

If I run /listexecutors or /listdiscovers, in both cases it finds
